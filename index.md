## About Me

<!-- During my undergraduate journey, I was an active member of [CyKor](https://ctftime.org/team/369), a hacking team, and deeply interested in information security. Now, as I transition into the field of AI, I am passionate about applying my skills to solve real-world problems from a hacker’s perspective. -->

<!-- ## Research Interests -->

- I am an Applied Research Engineer at [Krafton AI](https://www.krafton.ai/ko/), where I work on simulation and agent systems.
- I completed my M.S. in AI at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in February 2025, and earned my Bachelor’s degree in Cyber Defense from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do).
- My current interests are **Agentic AI**, **Social Simulation with AI**, and **Efficient AI**. During my M.S., I focused on efficient deep learning systems and diffusion model quantization. In my undergraduate years, I was active in whitehat hacking and CTF, and served as Vice President of [CyKor](https://ctftime.org/team/369).
