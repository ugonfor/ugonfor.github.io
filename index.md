## About Me

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in AI at KAIST. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Cyber Defense from Korea University and completed high school at the Korea Science Academy of KAIST (KSA).

During my undergraduate journey, I was an active member of [CyKor](https://ctftime.org/team/369), a hacking team, and deeply interested in information security. Now, as I transition into the field of AI, I am passionate about applying my skills to solve real-world problems from a hacker’s perspective.
