## About Me

<!-- During my undergraduate journey, I was an active member of [CyKor](https://ctftime.org/team/369), a hacking team, and deeply interested in information security. Now, as I transition into the field of AI, I am passionate about applying my skills to solve real-world problems from a hacker’s perspective. -->

<!-- ## Research Interests -->

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in AI at [CVML Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/cvml-kaist), KAIST. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Cyber Defense from Korea University.

I am deeply interested in enhancing the **efficiency of deep learning models**, not only from a software perspective but also by focusing on **hardware and system-aware optimization**. While my work has primarily focused on **diffusion model quantization**, my broader goal is to eliminate redundancies in computationally intensive models to achieve sustainable AI.
